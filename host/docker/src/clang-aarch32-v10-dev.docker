# because LLVM C++ library build process needs the LLVM native .a libraries,
# we need a two-stage process:
# * build a full clang-aarch32 image required to build the toolchain, then
# * build a .a -stripped version of the clang-aarch32 image useful to build
#   target application, saving image storage footprint
# This dockerfile is dedicated to build the second, enlightened one.

# docker build -f host/docker/src/clang-aarch32-v10-dev.docker -t clang-aarch32:v10-dev-10 .
# docker tag clang-aarch32:v10-dev-10 ${DOCKERHUB_USER}/clang-aarch32:v10-dev-10
